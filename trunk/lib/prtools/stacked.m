% DESCRIPTION
% The base classifiers (or mappings) W1, W2, W3, ... defined in the same
% feature space are combined in WC. This is a classifier defined for the
% same number of features as each of the base classifiers and with the
% combined set of outputs. So, for three two class classifiers defined for
% the classes 'c1' and 'c2', a dataset A is mapped by D = A*WC on the outputs
% 'c1','c2','c1','c2','c1','c2', which are the feature labels of D. Note that
% classification by LABELD(D) finds for each vector in D the feature label
% of the column with the maximum value. This is equivalent to using the
% maximum combiner MAXC,
%
% Other fixed combining rules like PRODC, SUMC, and MAJORC can be applied by
% D = A*WC*PRODC. A trained combiner like FISHERC has to be supplied with
% the appropriate training set by AC = A*WC; VC = AC*FISHERC. So the
% expression VC = A*WC*FISHERC yields a classifier, not a dataset as with
% fixed combining rules. This classifier operates in the intermediate
% feature space, the output space of the set of base classifiers. A new
% dataset B has to be mapped to this intermediate space first by BC = B*WC
% before it can be classified by D = BC*VC. As this is equivalent to D =
% B*WC*VC, the total trained combiner is WTC = WC*VC = WC*A*WC*FISHERC. To
% simplify this procedure PRTools executes the training of a combined
% classifier by WTC = A*(WC*FISHERC) as WTC = WC*A*WC*FISHERC.
%
% It is also possible to combine a set of untrained classifiers, e.g. WC =
% [LDC NMC KNNC([],1)]*CLASSC, in which CLASSC takes care that all outputs
% will be transformed to appropriate posterior probabilities. Training of
% all base classifiers is done by WC = A*WC. Again, this may be combined
% with training of a combiner by WTC = A*(WC*FISHERC).
